## Spiral clarity meets cloud storage ‚Äî built in Rust

I built AoXCloud because I wanted a simpler, faster file storage solution than existing options. After struggling with NextCloud's performance on my home server, I decided to create something that prioritizes speed and simplicity while still being robust enough for daily use.

![AoXCloud Dashboard](doc/images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202025-03-23%20230739.png)

*AoXCloud's straightforward interface for file and folder management*

## ‚ú® What makes AoXCloud different?

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource requirements compared to PHP-based alternatives
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, fast interface that works well on both desktop and mobile
- **Rust Performance**: Built with Rust for memory safety and speed
- **Optimized Binary**: Uses Link Time Optimization (LTO) for maximum performance
- **Simple Setup**: Get running with minimal configuration
- **Multilingual**: Full support for English and Spanish interfaces

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ and Cargo
- PostgreSQL 13+ database
- 512MB RAM minimum (1GB+ recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DioCrafts/AoXCloud.git
cd AoXCloud

# Configure your database (create .env file with your PostgreSQL connection)
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/AoXCloud" > .env

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run database migrations
cargo run --bin migrate --features migrations

# Run the server
cargo run --release
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8085`

## üß© Technical Implementation

AoXCloud follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External systems and implementations
- **Interfaces Layer**: API and web controllers

The architecture makes it easy to extend functionality or swap components without affecting the core system.

## üöß Development

```bash
# Core development workflow
cargo build                 # Build the project
cargo run                   # Run the project locally
cargo check                 # Quick check for compilation errors

# Optimized builds
cargo build --release       # Build with full optimization (LTO enabled)
cargo run --release         # Run optimized build

# Testing
cargo test                  # Run all tests
cargo test <test_name>      # Run a specific test
cargo bench                 # Run benchmarks with optimized settings

# Code quality
cargo clippy                # Run linter
cargo fmt                   # Format code

# Debugging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run    # Run with detailed logging
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

I'm actively working on improving AoXCloud with features that I need personally:

- User authentication and multi-user support (in progress)
- File sharing with simple links
- WebDAV support for desktop integration
- Basic file versioning
- Simple mobile-friendly web interface enhancements
- Trash bin functionality (in progress)

See [TODO-LIST.md](TODO-LIST.md) for my current development priorities.
